Alpha (uppercase Α, lowercase α; Ancient Greek: άλφα, álpha, modern pronunciation álfa) is the first letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 1.

It was derived from the Phoenician and Hebrew letter aleph Aleph - an ox or leader.

Letters that arose from alpha include the Latin A and the Cyrillic letter А.

In English, the noun "alpha" is used as a synonym for "beginning", or "first" (in a series), reflecting its Greek roots.
