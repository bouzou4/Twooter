# Twooter

A hastily designed backend + webserver combo written in go. Bother your friends and force them to make accounts on your server in all it's non-copyright-infringing glory.

## Getting Started

Clone the project and make sure you have go installed on your machine. I like to use gb for go project management but its not necessary to run.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install/use the software and how to install them

```
bash terminal
Go
```

### Installing

1. clone the repository
2. run 'run.sh'
```bash
bash run.sh
```
3. open up your browser of choice to localhost:8080
